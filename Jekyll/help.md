## Repos

- [Github Pages Ruby Gem](https://github.com/github/pages-gem) - A simple Ruby Gem to bootstrap dependencies for setting up and maintaining a local Jekyll environment in sync with GitHub Pages.
- [Minima theme](https://github.com/jekyll/minima)

To see your installed files of a theme such as mimima, run the following:

```bash
$ # View path
$ bundle show mimima
<PATH_TO_REPO>/vendor/bundle/ruby/2.3.0/gems/minima-2.5.0

$ # Open on Mac.
$ open $(bundle show minima)

$ # Open on Linux.
$ open-xdg $(bundle show minima)
```
